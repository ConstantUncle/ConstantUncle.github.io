## Research Interests

My current research interests are focused on exoplanets, astrobiology, planetary science, and the search for biosignatures. Previously, I have also studied systems engineering as well as astronomy across multiple wavelengths, including working with data from the MAXI X-Ray telescope while interning at JAXA.
